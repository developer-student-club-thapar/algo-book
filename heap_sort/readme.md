# Heapsort 

## Basics
1. __Heaps__ : The (Binary) heap data structure is an array object that can be viewed as a nearly complete binary tree.

> A binary tree with n nodes and depth k is complete iff its nodes correspnd to the nodes numbered from 1 to n in the full binary tree of depth k.

## What is Heapsort? 
Heapsort is a widely used algorithm and it can be very effieciently used to sort the list of items by transforming it into a heap data structure, a binary tree with heap properties.

## Why Heapsort?
